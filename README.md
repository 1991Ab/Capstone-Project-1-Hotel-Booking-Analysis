# Capstone-Project-1-Hotel-Booking-Analysis
Analyzing the data of bookings made by numerous customers across the globe for the Hotels
Problem Statement:

Have you ever wondered when the best time of the year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset?

The Approach we used in this project:

1.	Loading the data: In this section we just loaded the data in the colab notebook and read csv file.
2.	Data Cleaning and Processing: In this section we have tried to remove null values and replaced all the null values by some integer values and with some appropriate values.
3.	Analysis and Visualisation: In this section we have tried to explore all variables which can play an important role for the analysis. In the next part we have to explore the effect of one over the others.
4.	Future scope for further analysis: We observed that the August month has the busiest month over all the years. It means the maximum business happened in the August month. City hotel is busier that Resort hotel which means the City type hotel is more demanding that is why City hotel has the longer waiting time as compare to Resort hotel. In August, July and may month most number of guests are coming and most common room booked by the guests are Room Type ‘A’. So that Hotels can arrange their facilities accordingly. There are various columns which can play an important role in the analysis such as, is_cancelled, days_in_waiting_list, avg_waiting_time, arrival_date_month etc can play an important role for analysis.
